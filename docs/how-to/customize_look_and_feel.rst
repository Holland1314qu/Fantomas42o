Customize Zinnia look and feel
==============================

The templates provided for Zinnia are simple but complete and as generic as
possible. But you can easily change them by
`specifying a template directory`_. If you are not familiar with Django,
the part two of the excellent Django tutorial explains in detail
how to proceed for `customizing the look and feel`_ of the
:mod:`~django.contrib.admin` app, in Zinnia it's the same thing.

A good starting point is to copy-paste the :file:`zinnia/base.html` template,
and edit the :ttag:`extends` instruction for fitting to your skin.

.. note::
	* The main content is displayed in block named ``content``.
	* Additional datas are displayed in a block named ``sidebar``.

You can also create your own app containing some Zinnia's templates based
on inheritance. You can also create your own app containing some Zinniaâ€™s
templates based on inheritance. For example you can find these two
applications which aim is to transform the templates for Zinnia to be HTML5
ready, which can be a good starting point to make your own at :

* `Zinnia-theme-html5`_.
* `Django Blog Quintet`_.

.. warning::
   .. versionchanged:: 0.9

   `Django Blog Quintet`_ is no longer compatible with Zinnia, but still be
   a good example.
