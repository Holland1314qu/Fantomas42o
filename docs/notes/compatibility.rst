=============
Compatibility
=============

Zinnia tries to fit a maximum to the Django's standards to gain in
readability and to be always present when the version 3.4.2 of Django will
be here. :)

Predicting the future is a good thing, because it's coming soon.
Actually Zinnia is designed to handle the 1.10.x version and will reach the
release 1.12 easily without major changes.

But the evolution of Django causes some backward incompatible changes, so
for the developers who have to maintain a project with an old version of
Django, it can be difficult to find which version of Zinnia to choose.
