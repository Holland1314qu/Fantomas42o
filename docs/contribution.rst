Contributing to Zinnia
======================

Zinnia is an open-source project, so yours contributions are welcomed and needed.

------------
Writing code
------------

So you have a great idea to program, found a bug or a way to optimize the
code ? You are welcome.

Process
-------

#. `Fork
   <https://github.com/Fantomas42/django-blog-zinnia/fork>`_ the code on Github.
#. Checkout your fork.
#. Write unit tests.
#. Develop your code.
#. Test the code.
#. Update the documentation.
#. Commit your changes
#. Push to your fork.
#. Open a pull request.

Conventions
-----------

Code conventions are important in a way where they ensure the lisibility
of the code in the time, that's why the code try to respect at most the
:pep:`8`.

If you have already run the :doc:`buildout` script you can execute this
Makefile rule to check your code. ::

  $ make kwalitee

With a clear and uniform code, the development is better and faster.

Tests
-----

The submited code should be covered with one or more unittests to ensure the
new behavior and will make easier future developments. Without that, your
code will not be reliable and may not be integrated.

See :doc:`tests` for more informations.

---------------------
Writing documentation
---------------------

Sometimes considered like "annoying" by hard-core coders, documentation is
more important than the code itself! This is what brings fresh blood to a
project, and serves as a reference for old timers.

On top of this, documentation is the one area where less technical people
can help most - you just need to write a semi-decent English. People need
to understand you. We donâ€™t care about style or correctness.

The documentation should :

* Use **Sphinx** and **restructuredText**.
* Use **.rst** as file extension.
* Be written in English.
* Be accessible. You should assume the reader to be moderately familiar
  with Python and Django, but not anything else.

Keep it mind that documenting is most useful than coding, so your
contribution will be greatly appreciated.
